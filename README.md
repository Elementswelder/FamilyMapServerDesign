# FamilyMap Server

A server connection for the family map client, generates dummy data for each user that signs up.

General Instructions:
1.	Open IntelliJ.
2.	Select File -> Open...
3.	Navigate to the newly cloned repository and select it.
4.	Allow IntelliJ a few minutes to download any dependencies and set up the project.
5.	Once it is done loading, make sure the main function found in HelloWorld.java runs without errors. It is found inside the project in the ``src/main/java/HelloWorld.java`` directory. 
6.	Select Help -> Edit Custom VM Options and add the following line to the end of the file: `-Deditable.java.test.console=true` This is necessary to run the test driver properly.
7.	Select File -> Invalidate Caches / Restart.
8.	Once IntelliJ finishes restarting, you should be good to go. Good luck!
